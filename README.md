        * API Admin portal
        * Portals integration tests
Setup build environment
==================================

1. Install NodeJS 14.x or later LTS version from [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
 > **_Note :-_** 
   >  
   > You may use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) tool to manage NodeJS on your development environment
   >

> **_Note :-_** 
   >  
   > You can skip following steps if you don not want to build [product-apim](https://github.com/wso2/product-apim) binaries
   >

2. Install Maven from [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). * For Maven 3.8 and up, please check the Troubleshoot section.
3. Install JDK 1.8 [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).

Building & Running
==================================
### Build
 1. Download or clone the project source code from https://github.com/wso2/apim-apps

2. Open the `portals/` directory (where the lerna.json is located)

3. Run following commands from the `portals/` directory :

    i.  Run `npm run bootstrap` to install the dependencies for all 3 portals

    ii. Run `npm run build:prod` to build all 3 portal apps

4. If you are building the [product-apim](https://github.com/wso2/product-apim),

5. Run `mvn clean install` from the command line in the project root directory (where the root pom.xml is located).

6. Then you just need to build [WSO2 API Manager Server](https://github.com/wso2/product-apim) after. (Follow the guide there)

### Run

7. Extract the wso2am-4.0.0.zip and go to the 'bin' directory

8. Run the api-manager.sh or api-manager.bat script based on you operating system.

3. Access the respective WSO2 API-M interfaces
    * API Publisher web application is running at - https://localhost:9443/publisher \
  You may sign in to the Publisher using the default administrator credentials (username: admin, password: admin).
    * Developer Portal web application is running at - https://localhost:9443/devportal \
  You may sign in to the Developer Portal using the default administrator credentials (username: admin, password: admin).

Run in dev mode
==================================
1. If you do not build a WSO2 API Manager server from the above steps, Download the built distribution of WSO2 API Manager Server from http://wso2.com/api-manager. 

2. Execute api-manager.sh (For unix environment) or api-manager.bat (For windows environment) file from the bin directory to run WSO2 API Manager Server.

3. Goto `portals/` directory in the `apim-apps` repository

4. Run `npm start` to start all three portals in development mode.
